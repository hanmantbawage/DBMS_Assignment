1.Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)? 
->a).Create View Dailyorders
    as Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders; 
 -> views Not updateble due to distinct keyword are used in query.

b)Create View Custotals
as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers
where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum
Group by cname;
-> views Not updateble which consist join .

c)Create view Thirdorders
  as Select * from Dailyorders where
  odate=’1990-10-03’;
->Updateble  

d) Create view Nullcities
   as Select snum, sname, city
   from Salespeople
   where city is NULL
   OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;
->Updatble.

2.Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include
only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter or change
commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20. 
->create view Commission as select snum , comm from Salespeople where comm between  .10 and .20 with check option;

 grant insert , update on commission to user_name; 

3.Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date,
sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. The word SYSDATE can
therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the
value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the
Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the
Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is
given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given.
